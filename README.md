# crudtool

This project is a tool to Create, Read, Update, Delete, data in a MySQL Database.  
It is written in Go language, v1.11. So after cloning needs a "go build", or "go install".  
Running the executable we have a web server to connect on, with a browser.  
The executable does not need to run on the same box as the MySQL server. It may connect over TCP.  
  

This is a project under development. It is not a complete CRUD tool, yet.  
For now, only the Read functionality is in place.
